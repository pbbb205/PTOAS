Golden generator for the tcvt sample (f32 -> i16 with sat_mode=ON).

The input range intentionally stays inside int16 bounds so saturation mode is
still exercised in lowering without making the numeric golden depend on
overflow behavior. The expected result is therefore just truncation toward zero.
